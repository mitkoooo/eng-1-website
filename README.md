## Help with Assessment Part 2 (if you decide to keep this website)

Figuring out Vite and TailWindCSS may be confusing for people who use it for the first time.
This projects uses TailWindCSS classes to style html elements.

Documentation:
https://tailwindcss.com/

To edit website edit index.html like you would usually do with any website. The Weekly Updates container can be updated by updating Markdown.mdx component. This is because React code is injected into Weekly Updates container as it contains a div element with id "root".

I have created a separate React Component (PlantUmlDiagram.tsx) that renders PUML diagrams remotely and then displays them on a website. Use props PlantUmlCode and title to use this component in App.tsx

For any further help visit official React website (https://react.dev/) or contact Vadim Mitko at wnm510@york.ac.uk
